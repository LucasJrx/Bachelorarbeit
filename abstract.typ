Conducted at ABB AG (Engineered Solutions DC-Drives, Mannheim), this thesis evaluates the use
of flexible copper busbars as an alternative to rigid busbars and cables in DC drive switchgear, using
the DCS880-A platform as the reference case. The objective is to provide a decision basis covering
technical suitability, economics, compliance, and implications for design and manufacturing
processes; CREO, Inventor and EPLAN support the workflows. The methodology combines
standards review with calculations, measurements, and a case study, assessing current-carrying
capability, thermal and mechanical robustness, short-circuit withstand, contacting, and
material/assembly costs. Results indicate that flexible busbars are manufacturable and
assembly-friendly; for the studied geometry a continuous current of ~673 A at 90 °C busbar
temperature is feasible. A 400 A lab test yielded ≈47 °C, corroborating the approach within the
stated assumptions; full qualification requires type tests in accordance with IEC 61439 and UL
508A. Economically, clear benefits were found, especially for the H4 module: material costs drop
from 313.23 € (rigid) to 144.07 € (flexible), and assembly time typically from 3-4 h to 1-2 h per
module (labor rate 120 €/h). Overall, a hybrid roll-out is recommended: standardize flexible
busbars where they provide the highest value (e.g., H4/space-critical areas) while expanding
normative and process safeguards and scaling based on data
