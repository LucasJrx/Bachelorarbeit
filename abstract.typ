This bachelor thesis was written at ABB AG in Mannheim, in the Engineered Solutions DC Drives (MOSD) division, at the Mannheim site. It examines the use of flexible copper busbars as an alternative to rigid busbars and cables in switchgear construction for DC drives. The aim is to develop a reliable basis for decision-making regarding technical suitability and economic efficiency. In addition, conformity with standards is examined and the effects on planning and manufacturing processes are considered. Methodologically, literature and standards analysis are combined with analytical calculations, laboratory tests and a case-based analysis. Current carrying capacity, thermal and mechanical load capacity, short-circuit resistance, contacting, and assembly and material costs are evaluated.

The results show that flexible busbars can, in principle, be integrated in a manner that is suitable for production and easy to assemble. Analytical and experimental findings are consistent in their magnitude and support suitability under the boundary conditions considered. Type and verification tests in accordance with relevant standards are required for complete qualification.

From an economic perspective, the analyses indicate potential savings in material costs and reduced assembly times, particularly in space-critical applications. On this basis, a phased introduction model is recommended. Flexible rails should be standardised where the benefits are greatest, while standardisation and process requirements are gradually secured and scaling decisions are made on the basis of data.
